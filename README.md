This is a job simulation and survival-horror style game. A spin-off of multiple SCP (Secure, Contain , Protect ) genres, where the player will have to try to survive and explore the facility while facing hordes of monsters. For this particular scene, the player's goal is to escape the prison they are currently in, they will have to use their surroundings to escape.  The controllers are WASD to move, E and F to interact, P to customize your input.  Additionally, the scene will be used to implement the most recent version of the design pattern. This includes having a Singleton for managing the player's health, a custom input manager for command pattern, item creation using factory pattern and door interaction using observer pattern.
